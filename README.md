Project Title : LibyanFlight
Project contributers : Jamal Fowzi Ertimi

Overview:
This project attempts to ease the booking process for all people in Libya. The main problem that is happening now is that people have to physically go to a booking office to check for flights and book flights, and that can be quite difficult for most people and time-consuming, so the proposed system attempts to fix these problems and make the booking process fast and easy for all people ,by providing a web application that allows users to check for a flight or book a flight from the comfort of their home.

Thank you.
